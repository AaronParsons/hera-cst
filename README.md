# hera-cst
CST files containing beam patterns of HERA dish (swept parabola, modified PAPER feed)

FITS files are HEALpix, nside=128, ring ordering.  
The beam is pointed at (theta=0,phi=0) in the usual HEALpix spherical coordinate system (corresponding to the north pole).
The freuqency and orientation of the dipole are given in the file name.

The png files are orthographic projections of just the response in the forward hemisphere (theta < 90 degrees).
